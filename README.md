### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m a data scientist and generative AI enthusiast. I work at Hepsiburada, a leading e-commerce website in Turkey, where I partner with the marketing and growth teams to utilize programming, data analytics and machine learning to generate valuable insights and build robust ML models for marketing processes. I also design and implement recommendation systems to optimize the customer experience and boost sales.

In my spare time, I work on various generative AI projects, such as Stable Diffusion, LLMs, text-to-speech, and AGIs. As a musician and a generative AI enthusiast, I want to merge AI and art to create new music, performance and experience. Iâ€™m passionate about creating a personal coding assistant that can facilitate my job and my daily life. Iâ€™m also interested in creating quality tools that support AI practitioners and generative artists.

Iâ€™m currently learning:

- LLMs,Langchain,Llama
- Stable Diffusion applications
- MLOps
- Microsoft Azure AI

Some of my projects:

- Building data collection tools for code generative language modeling
- Implementing notebooks for AI artist use of research models
- Model design for a new AI art model
- Creating a customized personal AI image and video generation system with unique features
- Utilizing AI-generated music and visuals for dynamic live performance creation

I'm also involved in the launch of the SelfieDreams API as the engineering lead. I'm responsible for the public SDK, CI/CD, infra, and tooling.

I have extensive interest in these topics and projects and I welcome any inquiries or opportunities for collaboration from fellow AI practitioners. Please feel free to contact me if you share the same interest ðŸ‘¯
